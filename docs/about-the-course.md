<!-- Overview -->
This course explores how to how to provision Azure OpenAI Service, deploy models, and use them in generative AI applications. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to its powerful large language models, such as GPTâ€”the model behind the popular ChatGPT service.

> NOTE: To complete the interactive labs in this course, learners need an **Azure subscription** that has been **approved for access to Azure OpenAI Service**. The approval process 
can take **several days**.
